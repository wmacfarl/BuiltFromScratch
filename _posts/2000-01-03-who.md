# Who Am I?

I am Will Macfarlane, a Providence RI based designer, developer, and educator.  I make tools, spaces, communities, and experiences through which people of all ages can build, play, make, teach, and learn together.

For more information about me and my work see [my portfolio](http://wmacfarl.github.io).
